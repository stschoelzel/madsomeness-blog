# madsomeness Blog Project

Welcome to **madsomeness**, my personal dual-language blog where I jot down my thoughts, musings, and everything I love. This site is a playground for me to rate items—games, movies, products, you name it—in tier lists, simply because it’s my site and I can!

I’m not a professional developer (as you can see from the commit chaos), but after testing about ten frameworks, I’ve settled on **Astro** with the **Retypeset** theme by radishzz as a base. Fonts are provided under the SIL Open Font License:

## Getting Started

If you want to run it yourself for whatever reason:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
